Pong Game
Introduction
This Python script creates a basic implementation of the classic Pong game using the Turtle graphics library. The game features two paddles, a ball, and a scoring system.

Setup
Run the Python script in a compatible environment.
The game window will appear with two paddles and a ball.
Control the left paddle with the W and S keys.
Control the right paddle with the Up and Down arrow keys.
The ball moves between the paddles, and players score points when the opponent misses the ball.

Game Elements
Paddles: There are two paddles, one on the left and one on the right, controlled by different keys.
Ball: The ball moves between the paddles, bouncing off the walls and paddles.
Scoring: The game keeps track of the score for each player.

Controls
W: Move the left paddle up
S: Move the left paddle down
Up Arrow: Move the right paddle up
Down Arrow: Move the right paddle down

Game Logic
The game runs in a loop, continuously updating the screen and checking for collisions. The ball bounces off the walls and paddles. Players score points when the opponent misses the ball. The score is displayed on the screen.

Customization
Feel free to customize the game by adjusting parameters such as paddle speed, ball speed, or the scoring system. You can also enhance the game by adding features like sound effects or changing the appearance of game elements.
